ðŸ“Š Sensor Data Trends: Visualizing Min, Avg, and Max Values Over Time ðŸ“ˆ

I'm thrilled to share a Data Visualization app developed using R Studio! This app enables you to upload your data, select a date range, and choose specific sensors to generate interactive plots showcasing minimum, average, and maximum values over time.
 
The purpose of this program is to empower users to quickly identify patterns, outliers, and trends in the data, leading to a more informed analysis of data behavior during different hours (without installing any special programs). Additionally, I've prepared a tutorial video demonstrating how to use the app and provided simple instructions on formatting your Excel file.
 
When we share pleasant experiences with others, we enjoy them much more than we would alone. ðŸ˜Š
 
 
Feel free to explore and let me know if you have any questions or feedback. I hope this can be useful for anyone working in water and wastewater science.
 
For more explanations:
Minimum (Min):
Min values help identify periods when the sensor recorded the lowest readings. This information is crucial for understanding the range of values and detecting potential outliers or unusual events.
Average (Avr):
The average provides a central tendency measure, giving users a sense of the typical or average behavior of the sensor during different hours. It smoothens out variations and can highlight trends or patterns in the data.
Maximum (Max):
Max values help identify peaks or spikes in the sensor readings. This is crucial for recognizing instances when the sensor recorded unusually high values, indicating important events or conditions.
